Project for Optimization methods class @ Jagiellonian University

This project demonstrates the application of optimization methods in economics, specifically through the lens of Markowitz Theory. Named after Harry Markowitz, the theory is a fundamental concept in modern portfolio theory and plays a crucial role in financial economics. Our goal is to apply these optimization techniques to construct efficient investment portfolios.
